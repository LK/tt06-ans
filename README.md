# Hardware Accelerated Asymetric Numeral System (ANS) Encoder / Decoder

Implement a hardware efficient ANS (https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2540) encoder / decoder block in verilog. 

This can be used as part of a larger system, espcially to losslessly compress neural network weights on the flight in RAM constrained environments
